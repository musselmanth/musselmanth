### ðŸ‘‹ Hi there, I'm Tom

For the past five years I've worked for a brokerage service company providing world-class customer service, supervisory oversight, risk management, and onboarding mentorship and training. I've proven my ability to quickly master new highly technical skills, effectively communicate technical topics to others, work collaboratively as a team player, and perform accurately and efficiently in a high-stakes environment.

As someone who's always considered myself a life-long learner, I've dabbled in hobby software development projects over the years and found it utilizes my strengths that I most enjoy using. Recently I decided to make the plunge and make a career change and pursue software development full-time.

I'm a recent grad from the Backend Engineering program with the Turing School of Software and Design. I've spent the last 7 months diving deep into the fundamentals of OOP, Ruby on Rails, and building functional and well designed back-end services. I've also dipped my toes into some front-end technology like CSS, Javascript, and React with the goal of one day becoming a full-stack engineer.

I have a lot of background knowledge in financial products that could prove useful on the job. I am also passionate about promoting financial literacy, education, and sustainability/green tech. I also like to engage with any company I work for to help establish and meet goals of Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion.
